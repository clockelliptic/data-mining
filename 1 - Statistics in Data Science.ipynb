    "> 3. Understand the characteristics of some common distributions such as Normal, Binomial, Uniform, and Exponential \n",
    "> 4. Work with bi-variate data and calculate summary statistics such as Correlation and Causation \n",

    "> 1. __[`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/stats.html):__ The `stats` module in the SciPy Package offers many Statistical functions such as mean, zscore, correlation as well as other sub-modules for Continuous Distributions, Multivariate Distributions, and Discrete Distributions\n",
    "> 2. __[`numpy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/routines.statistics.html):__ The `numpy` package itself offers many Statistical Functions such as Order Statistics, Averages and Variances, Correlating, and Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. It is not necessary to access a sub-package within the `numpy` package like we did with `numpy.linalg`. Instead, we can simply execute the function directly from NumPy: `np.func_name`\n",

After separating the process from the data collection, we can see clearly that there are two sources of randomness and uncertainty. In particular, these are the uncertainty and randomness of the process itself, and the uncertainty of our collection methods.\n",
